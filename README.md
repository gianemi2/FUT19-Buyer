# FUT19 Buyer

**A very simple FIFA 19 Autobuyer coded in Laravel**

[FUT19 Buyer](https://github.com/InkedCurtis/FUT19-Buyer) is a simplistic FIFA 19 Autobuyer coded using the Laravel 5 Framework alongside the Backpack package.

This is a fork of (wonderful, give him a star) InkedCurtis work. This is not a supported fork, just something which I use for keep updated all of my bot at once. 
It has something new but does not have all new InkedCurtis private upgrade. 

## What's New

* Telegram Notification for use a channel with sound and one with not. Search how to get BOT TOKEN and CHAT ID. 
* Notification when bot finds too many players. 
* Set auto sell or just save cards in tradepile. Useful for market crashes.
* Set account name for better notification.
* Get list of most used players in a specified SBC. Just go to `YOUR_IP/used?sbc=LINK_TO_SBC_LIST`. For example `http://YOUR_IP/used?sbc=https://www.futbin.com/squad-building-challenges/ALL/544/Layvin%20Kurzawa`.
